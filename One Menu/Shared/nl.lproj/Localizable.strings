8. LIABILITY

8.1  Licensor's responsibility in the case of violation of obligations and tort shall be limited to intent and gross negligence. Only in case of a breach of essential contractual duties (cardinal obligations), Licensor shall also be liable in case of slight negligence. In any case, liability shall be limited to the foreseeable, contractually typical damages. The limitation mentioned above does not apply to injuries to life, limb, or health.

8.2  Licensor takes no accountability or responsibility for any damages caused due to a breach of duties according to Section 2 of this Agreement. To avoid data loss, You are required to make use of backup functions of the Application to the extent allowed by applicable third-party terms and conditions of use. You are aware that in case of alterations or manipulations of the Application, You will not have access to licensed Application.

8.3  Licensor takes no accountability and responsibility in case of users/customers experiencing allergic reactions and all the consequences of allergic reactions. FeatureX simply shows allergy information based on what restaurants provide. Therefore claims such as 'gluten-free', 'nut-free', 'lactose-free', etc. are completely the restaurants responsibility/accountability. Furthermore, FeatureX cannot guarantee that cross contamination is avoided in restaurants kitchens. One menu is not meant to be used as definitive source of information regarding food allergies, if you have a dangerous food allergy; please inform the restaurant and kitchen as cross contamination may still take place..

8.4  Licensor takes no accountability and responsibility in case of nutritional information deviating from other nutritional-calculation applications or programs. FeatureX calculates nutritional information based on the recipes that the restaurants provide. The provided information is a rough estimation as FeatureX does not guarantee that restaurants follow recipes exactly. Lastly, the nutritional information does not apply to altered Meals or Beverages with add-ons/Extra's.

8.5  Licensor takes no accountability and responsibility in case of restaurants not being able to provide a physical menu or some other alternative when the One Menu application is under maintenance/is unavailable to users. One menu was created as an extension to the already existing dine-in experience, not a replacement. .

8.6  Licensor takes no accountability and responsibility in case of Meals or beverages provided by the restaurant deviating from the images on the One Menu application. Restaurants provide their own images for the One menu application. When this is not the case, One menu provides a photography service and restaurants will make the final selection of images they want to use to represent their Meals/beverages. Therefore, differences between imagery and what is presented to the consumer in the restaurant is ultimately the restaurants responsibility..

8.7  Licensor takes no accountability and responsibility in case of the application not working/working incorrectly due to users not updating their Iphones to the latest Os provided by Apple. FeatureX consistently updates the One menu application for optimal performance on the newest Iphone operating systems provided by Apple. This is done to ensure the quality/reliability of the application. If users do not keep their Iphones and the application up to date, the company cannot guarantee the One Menu application to work as intended. One menu intends to provide up to date information. .
